19-03-2018 22:00 BEGAN IMPLEMENTING GRAMMAR VIA INTERFACES/OBJECTS
19-03-2018 23:00 FINISHED TREE STRUCTURE FOR GRAMMAR. NOT SURE WHAT EACH NODES REQUIRE AT THIS STAGE...

// SPENT 2 DAYS GOING BACK AND FORTH NOT KNOWING HOW TO PARSE
// MADE WAY TOO CLASSES TO REPRESENT GRAMMAR. CONFUSED MYSELF. NEEDED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE.
// MAYBE SPENT 5 HOURS IN TOTAL DOING THIS?

21-03-2018 15:00 BEGAN PARSING
21-03-2018 15:30 COMPLETED BASIC PARAGRAPH SLICING (\n\n)
21-03-2018 16:45 STOPPED WORKING ON PARSING HERE. WENT HOME.
22-03-2018 04:15 SLEPT EARLY, WOKE EARLY, BEGAN WORK ON PARSING HEADINGS
22-03-2018 06:10 HEADINGS REGEX TESTS INCLUDED AND ALL PASSING TEST CASES.
22-03-2018 06:15 GOING BACK TO SLEEP
22-03-2018 06:20 REALISED I WASN'T VALIDATING VALUE PASSED INTO CLI FOR OUTPUT FORMAT

22-03-2018 18:10 TAKING BREAK, READY TO PARSE INLINES. HEADERS ADDED TO TREE STRUCTURE.

LOST COUNT. PROBABLY ANOTHER 5 HOURS AT LEAST.

24-03-2018 00:20 PARTIALLY WORKING HEADER AND PARAGRAPH INTEGRATION MIXED. HEADERS OK. PARAGRAPHS AND TEXT ACTING FUNNY.
24-03-2018 01:30 IMPROVED PARAGRAPH SLICER. STILL NOT 100% FUNCTIONAL FOR PARAGRAPHS.
24-03-2018 03:05 PARAGRAPH SLICER WORKING NOW FOR HEADINGS AND PARAGRAPHS

Total Hours so far: 26.75... Shouldn't have spent 10 hours faffing about design.

24-03-2018 10:45 BEGAN WORKING. WRITING TESTS FOR PARAGRAPH SLICING
24-03-2018 11:05 WROTE SOME TESTS FOR PARAGRAPH SLICING. TESTED PRETTY CONCLUSIVELY.
24-03-2018 11:35 CLEANED UP CODE, REFACTORED TO MAKE PARSER MORE COHESIVE
